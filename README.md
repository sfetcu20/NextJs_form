# Interview starter

Create a simple responsive form with 3 form fields that will send a request to any endpoint.
The form fields should be:

- sale price without VAT as a HTML input
- VAT rate as a HTML select
- sale price with VAT as a HTML input

These 3 fields depend on each other. Whenever the user types a sale price without VAT, the sale price with VAT should be updated.

**Extra credit** for the inverse effect: whenever the sale with VAT is updated the sale price without VAT is also updated.

## Quick start

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

Start the local server

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Quick tips

You can build any file structure you find useful

You can include any external libraries in `site.config.js`

You can use Google, Stack Overflow, previously written code, anything you like.

## Interview goals

- correct problem completion
- hooks usage in React
- responsive and clean design

**Good luck and have fun!**
